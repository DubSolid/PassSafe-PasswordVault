README for Pass-Safe Password Manager


INSTRUCTIONS:
Remember to give the "run.sh" script execution privileges! This is done by typing this command:
if not run as root: sudo chmod +x run.sh.
Then execute the script by typing: ./run.sh


DESCRIPTION:
Running the "run.sh" script does a check to see if all the required files and directories
are present. If not, it displays an error message and exits. If all files ARE present 
in the directory it launches the main.py file and the application starts.
Running the main.py file will launch the application and make a new directory in the
current working directory. DO NOT delete this new directory.
Upon doing so ALL stored data will be lost.


IMPORTANT!
This application is part of a school project is is NOT meant for use
in production environments!!! The project application will most likely
contain some bugs and security can NOT be guaranteed.
